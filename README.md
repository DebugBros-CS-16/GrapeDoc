A mobile application that assists farmers in detecting grape leaf diseases and increasing their revenues through improved insights.

## DebugBros Team
We are a group of four people who work together to create this fantastic app. We came up with the idea jointly and have been building GrapeDoc from the ground up. We used Figma, Adobe XD for UIUX designing and Flutter/dart for developing. In addition, Firebase, Dialogflow, Google Colaboratory, Python, Tensorflow was being used for the back-end development. 

## Installation Guidelines
The GrapeDoc Apk is published in Github under the realeses, so you can easily navigate and get the most recent version.
