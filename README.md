A mobile application that assists farmers in detecting grape leaf diseases and increasing their revenues through improved insights.

## DebugBros Team
We consist of 4 team members that make this wonderful app happen. We came up with the idea together and have been working hard on GrapeDoc from scratch. We use Figma, Adobe XD for UIUX designing and Flutter/dart for developing. In addition, Firebase, Dialogflow, Google Colaboratory, Python, Tensorflow was being used for the back-end development.
