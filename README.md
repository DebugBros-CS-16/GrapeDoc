A mobile application that assists farmers in detecting grape leaf diseases and increasing their revenues through improved insights.


## Team DebugBros
We are a group of four people who work together to create this fantastic app. We came up with the idea jointly and have been building GrapeDoc from the ground up. We used Figma, Adobe XD for UIUX designing and Flutter/dart for developing. In addition, Firebase, Dialogflow, Google Colaboratory, Python, Tensorflow was being used for the back-end development. 


## What's New
  * Multi language support (Beta)
  * Bug fixes
  * Enhanced some features and UI

### Get to know about the Treatments
GrapeDoc is capable of identifying grape leaf disease. Machine learning is used to carry out this process. The user can upload or snap a photo from the device, and it will diagnose the disease and recommend appropriate treatments.

### Simple to Keep Track
The "Last Scan" option is available for users. This is unique to every user . So, whenever they upload an image to disease selection, the uploaded photo will be displayed on the home screen. 
Furthermore, when a user logs into the app with any device, they can access the most recent scanned image.

### Clarify your Doubts
GrapeDoc consists of an accurate chat bot and a voice bot. Google Dialog flow is used to implement these. The user can simply input or tell the bot their inquiries, and the bot will respond with appropriate responses.

The application includes a news feed that users can access directly from their home screen. This feed is up to date, and the user can visit the relevant website to learn more about the subject. This aids users in gaining information about the grape industry as well as alternate methods of grape production.
