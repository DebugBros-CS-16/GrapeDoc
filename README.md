A mobile application that assists farmers in detecting grape leaf diseases and increasing their revenues through improved insights.

## Team DebugBros
We are a group of four people who work together to create this fantastic app. We came up with the idea jointly and have been building GrapeDoc from the ground up. We used Figma, Adobe XD for UIUX designing and Flutter/dart for developing. In addition, Firebase, Dialogflow, Google Colaboratory, Python, Tensorflow was being used for the back-end development. 

## Installation Guidelines
The GrapeDoc Apk is published in Github under the realeses, so you can easily navigate and get the most recent version.

### Never Miss a Thing
The application includes a news feed that users can access directly from their home screen. This feed is up to date, and the user can visit the relevant website to learn more about the subject. This aids users in gaining information about the grape industry as well as alternate methods of grape production.

### Simple to Keep Track
The "Last Scan" option is available for users. This is unique to every user . So, whenever they upload an image to disease selection, the uploaded photo will be displayed on the home screen. 
Furthermore, when a user logs into the app with any device, they can access the most recent scanned image.
