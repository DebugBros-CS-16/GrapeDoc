          "Cause": "By the fungus Phyllosticta ampelicida. It infects the leaves, leaf stalks and cluster stems. Could cause complete crop loss.",

          "Solution": "Cultural Practices - For new plantations selecting a cultural location which also allows good air moment. ",
          "Sanitization": "Spotting the fungus early in the leaf and cleaning it off thoroughly.Fungicides should be sprayed in the period from early bloom untill three to four weeks after bloom. "

        "Cause": "Mainly caused by the fungus Togninia minima, while other fungi can also play a part.",
        "Symptoms": "Could be caused anytime during the growing season. Main symptom would be a striping on the leaf, which is shown by the discoloration and drying tissue around the main veins. It shows dark red in red varieties and yellow in others.",
        "Solution": "Cultural Control - Good management techniques, which include proper planting, irrigation, and fertility for young vines while avoiding devigorating stresses, both before and after planting, as well as strict sanitization. ",
        "Sanitization": "Chemical strategies to control these pathogens are difficult, as traditional techniques used for the control of surface pathogens do not penetrate dormant plants cuttings sufficiently to control fungi inhabiting the vascular system. Soaking infected dormant cuttings or vines in fungicides before grafting or planting has reduced disease incidence and severity but none are registered for this use. "
